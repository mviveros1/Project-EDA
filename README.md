Eye Movement Data Set for Desktop Activities

Please refer to the Rmd for the script.

Introduction
This repository contains a dataset of eye movement data for desktop activities, aimed at facilitating research and analysis in the field of eye-tracking studies. The dataset comprises 192 files, each capturing eye movement data during different desktop activities.

Prerequisites
Before using this dataset, ensure you have the following:

Kaggle Account: You must have a Kaggle account to access and download the dataset. If you don't have one, you can create one at https://www.kaggle.com/

Access to Download: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to download files from Kaggle datasets.

Mass Download Tool: A mass download tool is available on the Kaggle dataset page, allowing you to conveniently download all 192 files in one go. You can access the dataset here.

A folder where to store the downloaded files: After you download the files you can move the folder to the desired file path. You will need this file path to update the first line of the R script with the destination i.e., 'data' folder.

Download Instructions
Follow these steps to download the dataset:

Open the Kaggle dataset page: Eye Movement Data Set for Desktop Activities.

Navigate to the "dataset_normalised_5mins" folder.

Utilize the provided mass download tool by clicking on the 'Download' button on the upper right corner. This will download all 192 files at once into your specified destination. You do not need to download each file individually.

Alternatively, you can manually download individual files by selecting them from the dataset folder.

File Structure
The dataset is organized into folders, with each folder containing eye movement data for specific desktop activities. The file names are indicative of the corresponding activities.
