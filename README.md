# Project-EDA

<!-- DH general comments 

- I appreciate the project organization, but this readme is empty. Use it to introduce your project, note any setup steps. 

- Just looking at the filenames, relationship between `Project-EDA.R`, `Project-EDA.Rmd`, and `Project-EDA.html` is unclear.  Which script was used to generate the html file?  Why are there two different scripts? 

- I appreciate the detail you're giving in the text of the EDA.  But super long paragraphs create big walls of text, which are especially hard to read in the HTML format (relatively small font and wide body).  Break those up with paragraph breaks and code chunks. 

- Some sections of the EDA seem repeated, and overall the organization is confusing.
