Eye Movement Data Set for Desktop Activities

Introduction
This repository contains a dataset of eye movement data for desktop activities, aimed at facilitating research and analysis in the field of eye-tracking studies. The dataset comprises 192 files, each capturing eye movement data during different desktop activities.

Prerequisites
Before using this dataset, ensure you have the following:

Kaggle Account: You must have a Kaggle account to access and download the dataset. If you don't have one, you can create one at https://www.kaggle.com/

Access to Download: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to download files from Kaggle datasets.

Mass Download Tool: A mass download tool is available on the Kaggle dataset page, allowing you to conveniently download all 192 files in one go. You can access the dataset here.
